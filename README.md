# Discover-Factors-that-Affect-the-use-of-Wikipedia-as-a-Teaching-Resource
The scientific question I want to explore in this analysis is that what are the factors can
directly affect the teachersâ€™ use behavior in Wikipedia, and how strong are the causual
relationships between them. The approach consists four parts. First, I clean the data using
Jupyter Notebook, and load the data using Tetrad. Second, I generate a directed acyclic
graph using a proper algorithm, a statistical test/score, and parameters from Tetrad. Third,
I perform some qualitative and quantitative analysis on the generated graph after causal
discovery. Last, I summarize my result and do some discussion.
